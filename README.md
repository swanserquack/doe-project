# DOE Project

This is a github repository for my doe project. This is essentially a automatic firewall written in C++. This is my first program written in C++ so don't expect much in the way of quality. There will be a release when my doe deadline hits but even after that I will continue development allbeit less.

## Building and running the project

    git clone https://github.com/swanserquack/doe-project
    cd doe-project
    make
    sudo ./Firewall.out
