# DOE Project

This is a github repository for my doe project. This is essentially a automatic firewall written in C++.

## This branch is currently abandoned as I want to fully finish the main program before I consider porting to windows. I think I will be able to port it to windows in the future but It will take a while. In the meanwhile stick with linux.
